# Authors: Sergio Firpo and Vitor Possebom
# Code by: Vitor Possebom
# Function: Implement Confidence Sets and the Sensitivity Analysis Mechanism
#           for the Synthetic Control Estimator.
# Version: 05 - This is a preliminary version of a function to implement the
#          Confidences Sets and the Sensitivity Analysis Mechanism for the
#          Synthetic Control Estimator proposed by Firpo and Possebom (2017).
#          We use the RMSPE test statistic to compute confidence sets in this
#          code. The user may want to manually change the test statistic. Any
#          questions, suggestions, comments, critics can be sent to Vitor
#          Possebom (vitoraugusto.possebom@yale.edu). In particular, the user
#          may want to manually change the graphical parameters at the end of
#          this code.
