Replication code and data for: "Synthetic Control with Time Varying Coefficients: A State Space Approach with Bayesian Shrinkage" by Danny Klinenberg.

Ssrn url: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3774589

The code and model is written within the frame of the Rproject. All file references rely on the package "here". Everything will run smoothly if you operate within the Rproject.

The replication has two folders:

1) model - The code for Time-Varying Parameter Bayesian Lasso (BL-TVP)
2) simulations - simulations and empirical examples from Klinenberg 2021.
