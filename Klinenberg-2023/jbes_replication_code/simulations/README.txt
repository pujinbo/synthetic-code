Each folder corresponds to a part of the paper:

brodersen_sim: The code for the simulation utilizing the time varying parameters

ca_simulation: Comparing synthetic control, causal impact, and BL-TVP with data from Abadie et al. (2010)

ca_prop_empirical_mcmc: Empirical Monte Carlo with a time invariant DGP described in the paper.

ca_simulation organization is based off of the reproducible files in Samartsidis et al. (2019).
