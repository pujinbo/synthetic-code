## R files for empirical applications

Two of these files are used to reproduce things that appear in the paper :
- [DelaunayExampleforPaper.R](DelaunayExampleforPaper.R) : code for the figure with Delaunay triangulations,
- [EXB_Lalonde.R](EXB_Lalonde.R) : code for the NSW application.

Other files are reproducing applications that do not appear in the paper or illustrate some useful functions.

WARNING : Except for the two files cited above, there are no guarantees for the others. There might remain bugs, coding mistakes, etc.
